# BattleDot Game

BattleDot is a multi-threaded simulation game where players compete by "bombing" each other's positions on a grid. Each player is represented by a thread, and the game continues until only one player remains.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Setup

No compilation is necessary as the game is written in Python. However, you need to ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

## Running the Game

To run the game, you can use the command line interface. Navigate to the directory containing the game script (`battledot.py`) and run:

```bash
python battledot.py
